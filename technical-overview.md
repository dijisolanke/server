### Simplified Explanation

Imagine building a virtual meeting room where people can gather, see who's available, and start video conversations. Here's how you'd do it:

Create a central hub (server) where everyone connects.

Make a virtual lobby where people can see who's around.

Set up a system to introduce people who want to talk (signaling).

Help people find the best way to connect directly (STUN/TURN).

Create the video chat interface on people's devices.

Make sure people are matched fairly and don't try to talk to the same person at once.

Have backup plans for when connections don't work well.
